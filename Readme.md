## FAQ

#### What is HuntaX?

It is a tool that I'm currently working on, My motive is to build a Open source passive location tracking and Device information Grabber tool.

#### What is it made with?

Currently I'm a Intermidate in Javascript, so it's the basic language that's used in the Tool.

#### How is the progress?

As I'm not experienced, It's really getting hard for me to learn these all by my own. Any help in building this Open source tool would be appriciated.
